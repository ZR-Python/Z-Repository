Add insult to injury
Against the clock
Ahead of time
All ears
An arm and a leg
Around the clock
Around the corner
As time goes by
At the drop of a hat
Back to basics
Back to the drawing board
Bad apple
Ball in your court
Barking up the wrong tree
Beat around the bush
Behind the times
Bells and whistles
Best of both worlds
Best thing since sliced bread
Better late than never
Cut the cheese
Black and blue
Black and white
Black sheep
Blessing in disguise
Blind date
Blood, sweat, and tears
Blow a fuse
Blow up in your face
Blue in the face
Bottom falls out
Bring home the bacon
Broken clock is right twice a day
Burn the midnight oil
By the skin of your teeth
Call it a day
Catch them at a bad time
Chasing rainbows
Close to home
Costs an arm and a leg
Couch potato
Cover a lot of ground
Crack of dawn
Cross that bridge when you come to it
Cry over spilt milk
Curiosity killed the cat
Cut corners
Cut to the chase
Day to day
Days are numbered
Dead in the water
Count your chickens before they hatch
Drastic times, drastic measures
Drawing a blank
Dwell on the past
Easy as ABC
Every cloud has a silver lining
Fallen in love
Far cry from
Under the weather
Fill in the blanks
First out of the gate
Fish out of water
Foot in the door
For the time being
From now on
From time to time
Give the benefit of the doubt
Give the green light
Going places
Golden opportunity
Grass is always greener over there
Green with envy
Hard as nails
Heart set on something
Head in the clouds
Head over heels in love
Heard it from the grapevine
Heart is in the right place
Hit the books
Hit the nail on the head
Hit the panic button
Hit the road
Hit the sack
Hold the fort
Hot potato
Hour of need
In the bag
In the blink of an eye
In an instant
In the heat of the moment
In the long run
In the nick of time
In the red
In the right place at the wrong time
It takes two to tango
Itchy feet
Judge a book by its cover
Jump on the bandwagon
Keep something at bay
Keeping up appearances
Kept in the dark
Kill time
Kill two birds with one stone
Landslide victory
Last straw
Learn the ropes
Let sleeping dogs lie
Let something slip through fingers
let the cat out of the bag
Lick your wounds
Lightning fast
Like clockwork
Like there is no tomorrow
All the ducks in a row
Living beyond your means
Long time no see
Look on the bright side
Love at first sight
Lump in your throat
Make a long story short
Make my day
Make or break
Make the grade
Make time
Makes my flesh crawl
Making a go of it
Making headway
Match made in heaven
Method to their madness
Mile a minute
Miss the boat
Monkey business
Murphy's law
Never in a million years
No time like the present
No time to lose
Now and then
Now and again
Now or never
Off color
Off their rocker
Off to a flying start
Old school
On the ball
On the rocks
Once in a blue moon
Once upon a time
Only time will tell
Out of the blue
Out of time
Pass with flying colors
Penny for your thoughts
Picture worth a thousand words
Piece of cake
Pitch black
Pop the question
Pot calling the kettle black
Pressed for time
Proud of a peacock
Pull the plug
Pull wool over my eyes
Pulling out all the stops
Puppy love
Put your thinking cap on
Rags to riches
Raining cats and dogs
Raise the white flag
Raring to go
Rat race
Red herring
Red hot
Red in the face
Road hog
Roll out the red carpet
School of hard knocks
School of throught
Seeing eye to eye
Seeing red
Show of hands
Silver screen
Single file
Sink or swim
Sink your teeth into something
Sit on the fence
Slice of the pie
Smash hit
Sooner or later
Sour grapes
Speak of the devil
Speaks volumes
Spill the beans
Standing ground
Stand the test of time
Steal their thunder
Stiff upper lip
Storm in a teacup
Straight from the horse's mouth
Swallow their pride
Sweet tooth
Take each day as it comes
Take it with a grain of salt
Taste of their own medicine
Teacher's pet
The moment of truth
The ship has sailed
The time is ripe
Thinking on your feet
This day and age
Tickled pink
Tie the knot
Time after time
Time and time again
Time flies
Time for a change
Time heals all wounds
Time is money
Time is of the essence
Time of your life
Time on your hands
Time on your side
Too many chefs in the kitchen
Too much time on their hands
Top dog
Tough cookie
Tricks of the trade
True colors
Turn back the hands of time
Up in smoke
Waiting in the wings
Walk out on someone
Wasting time
Whale of a time
White as a sheet
White elephant
White lie
Whole nine yards
Works like a charm
Can't teach an old dog new tricks
Your guess is as good as mine
Take it one day at a time
Everything under the sun
