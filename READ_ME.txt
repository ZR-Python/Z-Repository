Our project is called Zombie Typing

It was created by:

This game is meant to put your typing skills to the test. Our hero must fight waves of zombies
in three unique levels before facing up against the final boss. To defeat a zombie, type the
words that are above their head in the text box. Make sure to spell it exactly right or else
you won't get your shot.

We recommend starting off on the "Normal" and "Slow" difficulties, but if you believe
that you have excellent typing skills you can turn up the challenge.

In order to defeat the walking dead, you should already be familiar with the home row keys
and have some typing knowledge.

In this folder you will find the Application File.

The folder labelled "HackYSU Project" contains all of the various files that we created
and used for Zombie Typing.

We hope you enjoy Zombie Typing.
